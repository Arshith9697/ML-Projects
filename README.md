Projects:

ðŸ’³ Resilient Anti-Fraud System: Addressing Deceptive ATM Transactions
Developed an anti-fraud system to detect deceptive ATM transactions through live data analysis. Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and EDA to ensure data integrity and uncover underlying patterns. Standardized columns for consistent model performance and leveraged advanced anomaly detection methods such as Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM. Multiple models were developed and fine-tuned, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in fraud detection.

ðŸš— Insurance Claim Probability Prediction
Built a predictive model to determine the probability of car insurance claims based on comprehensive car policy features and safety ratings. Conducted extensive EDA and data preprocessing, including the use of SMOTE to address data imbalance and prevent overfitting. Classification-based supervised machine learning algorithms were employed, with performance evaluated using metrics such as the confusion matrix, classification report, and area under the curve (AUC).

ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
Constructed a movie recommendation system by performing data preprocessing to clean and format the data effectively. Utilized the Bag of Words approach, specifically Count Vectorizer, to convert textual data into numerical vectors. Leveraged cosine similarity from the sklearn.metrics.pairwise module to calculate similarity scores between movie vectors. This robust system identified and recommended movies with high similarity scores, enhancing the user recommendation experience.

ðŸ”‹ Energy Score Prediction for Buildings
Developed a comprehensive predictive model using regression-based supervised machine learning algorithms to determine the energy score of buildings. Through thorough data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), key features influencing the energy scores were identified, enhancing the understanding of energy efficiency in buildings. The model's accuracy was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), RÂ² score, and adjusted RÂ² score.
